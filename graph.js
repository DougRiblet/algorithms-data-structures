// GRAPHS

// Abstract data type

// Basic Graph:
// Stores nodes (represented by any primitive value) and the neighbors for
// each node. This implementation represents a graph as an adjacency list.

// Constraints:
// This graph implementation is undirected and can have unconnected nodes.
// The nodes are represented by unique primitive values.
